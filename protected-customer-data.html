      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        onspruce solutions ("we") and Cart Insights ("the App") are dedicated to
        customer and user privacy and data protection. We only collect and use
        data that is needed to provide the App's functionality. We do not share
        or sell data to any third party. For additional details, see the
        <a href="cart-insights-privacy-policy.html">Cart Insights Privacy Policy</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Customer Data Compliance – Level 1</h2>
      <p>
        Processing personal data comes with legal and regulatory requirements to
        secure, monitor, manage, and communicate about that data. The App uses
        the minimum data required to provide its functionality, which helps
        reduce the effort involved in compliance and limits the potential impact
        of a data breach or unauthorized access.
      </p>
      <h3>Personal Data the App Processes</h3>
      <p>
        Processing of personal data by the App is limited to the following
        purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer first and last name</strong> – used to provide App
          functionality to shop admin users by identifying cart contents per
          customer and helping shop admins provide customer service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer email, checkout email, order email</strong> – used to
          associate carts and orders with a customer so that shop admins can
          follow up and provide customer service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Order shipping address province, state, and country</strong> –
          used to identify order geolocation to help shop admins provide
          customer service and improve shop functionality, services, and
          geographic marketing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Customer cart contents</strong> – used to identify which items
          are in a customer's cart so shop admins can provide customer service
          and better understand cart activity.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Personal Data Processing Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Processing is limited to stated purposes.</strong> Processing
          of personal data is limited to clearly stated purposes so that
          merchants and customers are correctly informed about how their data is
          used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We respect customer consent decisions.</strong> Customer
          consent is a critical mechanism for customers to participate in their
          data processing. The App processes GDPR data request and GDPR erasure
          requests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>We honor opt-out decisions.</strong> We respect customer
          decisions to opt out of any data sharing, such as a "data sale" or
          similar concept, and we comply with applicable laws and regulations
          around sharing of personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No automated decision-making.</strong> The App does not use
          personal data for automated decision-making, including profiling,
          analyzing, predicting, or scoring algorithms that would have legal or
          similarly significant effects on individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data protection agreements with merchants.</strong> We make
          privacy and data protection agreements with merchants that install the
          App. These agreements formalize how personal data is processed and are
          an important tool for safe data privacy practices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Defined retention periods.</strong> We apply specific
          retention periods to make sure that personal data is not kept longer
          than necessary for the stated processing purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Encryption at rest and in transit.</strong> Data is encrypted
          when stored and when transmitted across networks. Our database data is
          encrypted, our backups are encrypted, and our database connections
          require encryption.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Customer Data Compliance – Level 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Encrypted data backups.</strong> Data backups contain personal
          data and are treated with the same level of concern and consideration
          as production data in order to prevent unauthorized access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Separate test and production data.</strong> We keep test and
          production data separate so that personal data from production does
          not leak into less secure environments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data loss prevention strategy.</strong> Our data loss
          prevention strategy combines technical controls, policies, and
          standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited staff access.</strong> We limit staff access to
          protected customer data to prevent data from being improperly
          accessed, exfiltrated, or processed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strong authentication for staff.</strong> Staff accounts are
          protected with strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Access logging.</strong> We keep and review access logs so
          that there is an audit trail of activity related to data access.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security incident response policy.</strong> Our security
          incident response policy helps us respond appropriately to security
          incidents and data breaches should they ever occur.
        </li>
      </ul>
