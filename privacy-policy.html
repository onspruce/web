      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cart Insights collects, uses, and shares information when you use the app with your Shopify store.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content policy">
      <h2>Cart Insights Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Cart Insights ("the App") provides shopping cart activity data ("the Service") to merchants who use Shopify to power their stores. This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is collected, used, and shared when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.
        You can also read more about our practices on the
        <a href="protected-customer-data.html">Protected Customer Data Compliance</a>
        page.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Information the App Collects</h2>
      <p>
        When you install the App, it is automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account as well as request data that is sent by Shopify to the App.
      </p>
      <p>The following Shopify API access permissions are requested upon installation of the App so that it can function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>read_products</strong>: in order to display a shop's customer cart activity, the App requests product data via the Shopify API such as the product title, variant image URL, and variant title.</li>
        <li><strong>read_customers</strong>: in order to display customer data in the context of customer cart activity within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>read_orders</strong>: in order to display order data in the context of customer cart activity within the App, namely to show when a cart converted into an order and to be able to create a link to view the order in the Shopify Admin console.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        Data collected and stored by the App is automatically deleted from our database after it is not used by the App or updated by subsequent same customer activity for 62 days. CSV reports that are generated by a merchant are automatically deleted from AWS storage after 92 days.
      </p>

      <h2>How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>
      <p>
        We use the personal information we collect from you and your customers in order to provide the Service and to operate the App. Additionally, we use this personal information to communicate with you; optimize, troubleshoot, or improve the App; and provide you with information relating to our products or services.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        Information about the shop that has installed the App, and information about any customer activity and data collected by the App is never shared with any third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we may also share your personal information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
      </p>

      <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
      <p>
        The App is compliant with Shopify GDPR Mandatory Webhooks as described here:
